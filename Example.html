        <h3>Now speaking of the website developer here, I may not be there close to you physically but trust me, I am only one call away. You met me on June 2nd. Man how destiny just gets through is really
            marvellous. I was really not supposed to come to that program but something told me that I really should be there, and guess what, my gut was right. That was the day
            that really changed my life. Sometimes one of the best people enter your life unexpectedly and be the most important part throughout life. Then comes June 3rd,
            the day we went out on our "friendly date". Gosh, the conversation, the eye contact, the warmth in our auras, it was so heavenly, after the date we went to
            that specific park and we sat there by the river, talking about life and our past traumas, I have never connected so much with someone so soon, I really felt 
            as if you were an integral part of my life forever. Then comes June 6, we planted that imaginary tree as if it were to be our own kid. Sounds childish, but
            we will always be us due to that tree. Then comes June 7 morning, when we went out early in the morning to do god knows what. I remember talking to you
            over the phone till 4am the night before. I picked you up, we went out for a ride, a beautiful sunrise, with cool breeze all along. We went till Gangapur 
            dam and then we started returning. On the way back, we stopped by the Ganpati temple. Then comes June 8, the day we went out to the mall for the first time,
            man that was hilarious. So, these are glimpses of our initial days, those late night talks, those virtual hugs, singing songs together and living nostalgia.
            And they lived happily ever after. We spent one of the best time together in those two weeks of friendhsip. Then I came to my college 4 hours away from you.
            I remember that last hug, that shedding of one last tear. And so on and so forth. So even if long distance, we've continued to be each other's best supportors.
            I love you and we will make this work. I will always be with you and will treat you the right way. Together let's do wonders and make miracles come true.
            I love you and happy birthday once again.
